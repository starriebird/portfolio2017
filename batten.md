I am an assistant director of web design and development for the Batten School of Leadership & Public Policy at the University of Virginia. I am responsible for the design, development, and testing of the school's websites. I work with a team of web developers to create websites that are user-friendly, informative, and visually appealing. I also work with the school's marketing team to develop and implement web-based marketing campaigns. I am passionate about using web design and development to help organizations communicate their message effectively and reach their target audiences.

I report to the Director of Technology & Information Systems and work with the Director of Communications to create pages on the Batten website. I am the Senior Developer and Technical Lead for two Drupal applications in Acquia Cloud: Batten School Main and Batten School Affiliates.
