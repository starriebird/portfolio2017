I have been building websites since 1998, and have worked at University of Virginia since 2008: at the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, Web Communications, University of Virginia Library, UVA Advancement Communications and currently at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. In early 2015 I founded a local Google Developer Group - GDG Central Virginia.

I have always been fascinated with technology, and find it to be an endless source for creative expression, whether it be for interactive media in it's various forms, musical compositions, or multimedia installations.
