I have been formally educated in web design & development and have been working in the field since the late 1990s. I have worked both in the private and higher education sector, but mostly at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> since 2002. Within the University I have held technology positions at the <a href="https://curry.virginia.edu">Curry School of Education</a>, <a href="https://as.virginia.edu">College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, <a href="https://communications.virginia.edu">Web Communications</a>, <a href="https://library.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Library</a>, and currently at the <a href="https://batten.virginia.edu">Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy</a>. I greatly enjoy this working environment and take advantage of every learning opportunity UVA's academic setting encourages.


In early 2015 I founded Google Developer Group Central Virginia. This has enabled me to keep abreast of "inside" information about future trends in technology - about 5 years into the future. Through continual financial and logistical support from Google, I educate and organize a local community of developers about the latest best practices in development and user led design, as well as innovative technologies and their potential applications. I also serve as a Women TechMaker Mentor in the Mid-Atlantic Region in the United States. Women TechMakers lead by example and are made visible to inspire a new generation of women in the technological field.

I have always been fascinated with technology, and find it to be an endless source for creative expression and practical use. I believe that technology's greatest potential is to solve humanity's greatest problems.
