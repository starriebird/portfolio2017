I am fortunate to have been both formally educated in web design and development and working in the field since the late 1990s. I have worked both in the private and higher education sector, but mostly at the University of Virginia since 2002. Within the University I have held technology positions at the Curry School of Education, College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, Web Communications, University of Virginia Library, and currently at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. In greatly enjoy this working environment and take advantage of every learning opportunity UVA's academic setting encourages.


In early 2015 I founded GDG Central Virginia. This has enabled me to keep abreast of "inside" information about future trends in technology - about 5 years into the future. Through continual financial and logistical support from Google, I educate and organize a local community of developers about latest best practices in development and user led design, as well as innovative technologies and their potential applications. I also server as a Women TechMaker Mentor in the Mid-Atlantic Region in the United States. Women TechMakers lead by example and are made visible to inspire a new generation of women in the technological field.

I have always been fascinated with technology, and find it to be an endless source for creative expression and practical use. I believe that technology's greatest potential is to solve humanity's greatest problems.

In 2019 I was accepted to UVA's McIntire School of Commerce Management of Information Technology graduate program.
