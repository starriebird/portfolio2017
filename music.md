<h3>TechnoBass.net</h3>

Since the 1990s I have DJed electronic music and became passionate about a particular genre from Detroit called "Techno Bass." I had the idea of creating an online music magazine promoting it. We are now running on our thirteenth year.

I hosted a long running radio show on WTJU at the University of Virginia, The Binary Mix Sessions  which moved to prestigious internet radio stations such as Breaks.fm , Global Funk Radio and have played guest spots on Electroinvasion (Frequency Radio) and Bass Agenda.
