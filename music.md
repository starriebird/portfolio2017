<h3>DJ Mixes and Radio - Binary Mix Sessions</h3>

I have DJed at events and music festivals in Philadelphia, Charlotte, Washington D.C., and Charlottesville, VA as well as radio stations local and abroad. I hosted a long running radio show on WTJU at the University of Virginia, The Binary Mix Sessions which moved to prestigious internet radio stations such as Breaks.fm , Global Funk Radio and have played guest spots on Electroinvasion (Frequency Radio, Germany), Stressfactor.co.uk and Bass Agenda (UK).

<h3>TechnoBass.net</h3>

Since the 1990s I have DJed electronic music and became passionate about a particular genre from Detroit called "Techno Bass." I had the idea of creating an online music magazine promoting it. We are now running on our thirteenth year.

<h3>Fundamental Bass Intelligence</h3>

In 2003 I was invited to be an equal partner in an electro record label based in Washington D.C., USA. I contributed to selecting releases, art direction, graphic design for vinyl records and cds.

<h3>Jackal and Hyde Music</h3>

I am the webmaster for the tear out electro-core band Jackal and Hyde.

"Eectro-core reloaded! Five years since their last release, Jackal & Hyde aka Scott Weiser &amp; Todd Walker re-emerge on Germany’s legendary Dominance Electricity label. This duo is responsible for some of the most head strong electro-core bass bangers in the 00s such as Dark Star, Go Bang, Beyond and Sound of Underground. Besides their original work, Jackal & Hyde's sound has been requested for multiple remix productions including Rabbit in the Moon, Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Love & Rockets and Genitorturers among others. With their latest offering entitled ‘Bad Robot’ (Dominance Electricity), they continue their mission to create the perfect blend of relentless club power and futuristic darkness. Jackal and Hyde live shows are eclectic full frontal sonic assaults which appeal to a wide variety of fans from EDM club kids, ravers and break dancers, to goths, gravers and industrial heads alike. For the last decade they have played shows with a wide variety of groups from The Prodigy, Bassnectar and Stanton Warriors to Rabbit in the Moon, Combichrist and Krewella at venues all across the United States and abroad. Always be prepared for an Earth shaking set from these masters of tear out electro."
