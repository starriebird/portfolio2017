<h3>"Fair Use In Seven Words," University of Virginia Library</h3>

I worked with other Library staff to conceptualize and storyboard a short video to teach UVA students about fair use. I designed and produced the video using motion control techniques along with recommended design elements for video from the UVA branding style guide using Adobe After Effects.
