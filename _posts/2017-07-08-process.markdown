I was asked recently how long each stage of the design and development process is supposed to last for the Staff website redesign project. I thought that was a great question, and felt like the best way to explain it would be to create a visual to communicate each step in the process. I used a pyramid shape to explain how designing and building a website or application can be analogous to physical construction of a pyramid. Each stage builds upon one another, with the initial research, planning, design and testing stages taking up the most time. Once that foundational work has been completed, the digital materials of code and decoration come together quickly.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
