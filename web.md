	<h3>Frank Batten School of Leadership & Public Policy, University of Virginia</h3>

Since March 2019 I served on committee meetings with internal stakeholders and vendors to help determine requirements, give feedback on design, help with process, search engine optimization and general guidance on development. I helped with the launch of the website and currently manage the training of web editors, content and design updates, and external vendors for further custom development.
