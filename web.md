<h3>OpenGrounds, University of Virginia</h3>

I worked with a software engineer to implement preliminary designs made by a freelance designer to build a new website in Drupal. I modified the designs to be more user friendly by creating a sitemap, worked with the Program Manager to rewrite site content, built the front end and wrote 700 lines of CSS to implement OpenGrounds branding from their style guide.
